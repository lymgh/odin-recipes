            <li>6 Pieces of Boneless Chicken Thigh with the skin on. <em>Cut into 1-inch cubes.</em></l>
            <li>2.5 Tbsp of Soy Sauce</l>
            <li>3 Tbsp of Chinese Cooking Wine <em>optional</em></l>
            <li>1 tbsp of Minced Garlic</l>
            <li>1 Tbsp of Five Spice Powder</1>
            <li>1 Large Egg</l>
            <li>3.5 Tbsp of Rice Flour</1>
            <li>1.5 Cup of Thai Basil</l>
            <li>2 Cup of Tapioca Starch</l>
            <li>Seasoning Mix – chili powder, paprika, five-spice powder, white pepper, garlic powder, and salt</l>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the chicken with soy sauce, Chinese cooking wine (optional), minced garlic, and Five Spice Powder for 20 minutes.</l>
            <li>After 20 minutes, add in 3.5 tbsp of rice flour and one egg and mix. You want a wet batter consistency.</l>
            <li>Coat the chicken with Tapioca Starch and let it sit for 5-7 minutes to prevent the coating from falling off.</l>
            <li>In a pan, add in oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil is hot, add in the Thai Basil and fry it for 30 seconds – 1 minute or crispy. This will help with fragrant oil.</l>
            <li>Next, add the chicken and fry the chicken for 4-5 minutes or until golden brown.</l>
            <li>Optional, but highly recommend, turn the heat to high and double fry the chicken for 1 minute and the basil for 30 seconds.</l>
            <li>Sprinkle on the seasoning mix and ENJOY!!</l>
        </ol>
